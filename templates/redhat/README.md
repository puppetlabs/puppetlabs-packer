# puppetlabs-packer

### About

This contains the vmware.base and vmware.vsphere image templates for Redhat FIPS-enabled platforms. FIPS is the Federal Information Processing Standard, which sets certain standards for the use of cryptographic modules in software.

### Building

All templates must be built in the `<os_dist>/<variant>/<arch>` directory. Make sure that the environment variable PACKER\_VM\_OUT\_DIR is set so that Packer knows where to copy the build artifacts (it is common to set it to ".", the current `<os_dist>/<variant>/<arch>` directory). If you are building a template with a vmware-vmx builder, be sure to set the PACKER\_VM\_SRC\_DIR environment variable to the directory containing the directory containing the relevant vm files. It is common to set PACKER\_VM\_SRC\_DIR = PACKER\_VM\_OUT\_DIR to make it easy to build a vmware-vmx template from a previous vmware build.

To build any template in the `templates/common` directory, type:
```
packer build -var-file=../../common/vars.json -var-file=vars.json ../../../common/<template-file>
```

For example, if you want to build the vmware.vsphere.nocm template, type
```
packer build -var-file=../../common/vars.json -var-file=vars.json ../../../common/vmware.vsphere.nocm.json
```
